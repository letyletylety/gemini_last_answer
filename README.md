Gemini Markdown Copy
A simple and powerful Chrome extension that provides a keyboard shortcut to instantly copy Gemini's responses with clean, perfect Markdown formatting.

The Problem
When you copy and paste content from Gemini's web interface, all of the formatting—like headings, bullet points, and code blocks—is lost. You are left with plain, unformatted text that requires manual reformatting. This extension solves that problem by preserving the original Markdown.

Features
One-Step Copy: Use a single, intuitive keyboard shortcut to copy the entire last response.

Perfect Markdown: Converts HTML formatting (like h1, ul) back into clean Markdown syntax (#, *).

Intelligent Code Blocks: Automatically detects code blocks and converts them with the correct language name for proper syntax highlighting.

Visual Feedback: A subtle pop-up in the bottom-left corner confirms a successful copy operation.

2. Move to **Manage Extensions** - **Keyboard shortcuts**, then set up the copy shortcut.

Usage
Open Gemini and chat as you normally would.

The Markdown-formatted response is now on your clipboard, ready to paste anywhere you need it.
